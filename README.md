# OMOFuse
 A new state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithm with excellent qualitative and quantitative performance.

The code displays mostly libraries that need to be installed for Matlab and C++ versions. However, we can run it using PyCharm to ensure a similar experimental environment as much as possible.
