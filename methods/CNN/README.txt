The demo file is Script.m

The implementation of image pyramids originates from the code developed by Dr. T. Mertens, available at https://mericam.github.io/. We also use some code contained in the popular image fusion toolbox developed by Dr. O. Rockinger, available at http://www.metapix.de/toolbox.htm) are employed in our toolbox. We would like to thank Dr. Mertens and Dr. Rockinger for their great contributions.
